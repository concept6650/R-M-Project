          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>
            Italy is a country where history, art, and natural beauty come
            together in a way few places can match. From the ancient ruins of
            Rome to the romantic canals of Venice, the Renaissance treasures of
            Florence, and the sun-drenched coastlines of the Amalfi and Cinque
            Terre, Italy offers unforgettable culture and scenery. The capital
            is Rome, and the primary language is Italian, though English is
            widely spoken in major tourist destinations. The best time to visit
            is spring and autumn for comfortable weather and lighter crowds.

          <h1>Getting around</h1>
          <h2>Transport</h2>
          <p>
            Italy’s rail network is extensive and convenient. High-speed trains
            like Frecciarossa and Italo connect major cities quickly, while
            regional trains reach smaller towns and countryside areas. Urban
            travel is easy with metro systems in Rome, Milan, and Naples, along
            with buses and trams. Renting a car is helpful for rural regions
            such as Tuscany, Puglia, or the Dolomites, where public transport is
            limited. Ferries connect coastal cities and islands like Sardinia,
            Sicily, and Capri.
          </p>
          <h2>Safety</h2>
          <p>
            Italy is generally safe, with most visits trouble-free. The main
            issue travelers encounter is petty theft in busy cities—especially
            around major attractions, train stations, and public transit. Keep
            valuables secure and be mindful in crowds. Central areas are
            typically safe at night, though some neighborhoods around large
            train stations can feel rough after dark. Follow local guidance
            during major holidays and events, which can draw large crowds.
